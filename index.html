			<h2>Cover Letter</h2>
			<p>
				The luxury and fashion sector are two sectors that have always fascinated me and that correspond to my personality. Indeed, I am a perfectionist, picky, organized and ambitious person. I participate in the creation of a fashion brand. 
				<br>In addition, I developed a creativity thanks to my arts classes as well as a great curiosity. For example, I was able to learn how to use the Adobe suite (Photoshop) by myself. This allowed me to increase my flexibility and learning abilities. 
				<br>Thanks to numerous conferences with various major brands, organized in partnership with ESSEC, my motivation to work in this field has been increased tenfold and has confirmed my choices.
